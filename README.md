# minimum quotient cut planar graph
 
This algorithm computes the sparsest cut of a planar graph in a polynomial time. This is an implementation of the algorithm described in 1993 by james Park and Cynthia Phillips in this article  https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/167088.167284

More informations about the algorithm and examples of cut are on the Jupyter notebook
